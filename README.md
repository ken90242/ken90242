My name is Hung-Kuang Han. I have a well-rounded background that spans software engineering.
Currently, I am a CMU student who focuses on software engineering, and I have expertise with Python, JavaScript, SQL, Docker, k8s, and machine learning.

Previously, I worked at Houzz as a full-stack developer, designing and implementing the build & release platform with Node.js, React, MongoDB, k8s, and RESTful APIs.
I also worked for Trend Micro, which is a well-known company developing anti-virus in the world.
I spent one-and-a-half years as a backend developer, building new features on a virus-scanning core module with Python, C++, and a GUI wizard with C#, VBScript, C++, Shell script.

I received my B.S. from the Department of MIS at NCCU in June 2016 and M.S. from the Department of IM at NTU in June 2019 when I worked with Professor Chien-Chin Chen. I have published one conference paper (pdf) in the 2019 ACM Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Computing Conference (AICCC). During my student life, I participated in several competitions. Fortunately, I received the Best Team Award at Fintech Contest organized by The Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank 2017, and a Second Place Intelligence Project Management Contest organized by Formosa Project Management Association in 2014.
